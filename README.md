linux file permission

Create a file with .txt extension (/home/demo.txt). Change the permission set of that file, so that any user can read it, group can read/write & owner can read/write/execute it.

7 (rwx) for the owner (read, write, execute) • 6 (rw-) for the group (read, write) • 4 (r--) for others (read)
